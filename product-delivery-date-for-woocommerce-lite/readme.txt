Allow the customers to choose a delivery date on the frontend product page for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Delivery Dates play a vital role in any type of Ecommerce store for customer satisfaction & retention. That is why we built the [Product Delivery Date plugin](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/product-delivery-date-pro-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=ProductDeliveryDateLite).

This plugin will allow the customer to choose a delivery date on the WooCommerce product page on your website. The customer can choose any delivery date that is after the current date. The site administrator can enable or disable the delivery date capture on the frontend product page.

This plugin allows you to improve your customer service by delivering the product on the customer's chosen date. 

### This plugin allows you to do the following:

<ol>
<li>You can set <strong>minimum required time for delivery</strong> in hours.</li>
<li>You can choose how long in future you want to take deliveries</li>
<li>It uses the inbuilt WordPress datepicker.</li>
</ol>
